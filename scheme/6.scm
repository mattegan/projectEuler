;; Project Euler Problem #6
;; The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
;; 		1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
;; The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
;;		(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
;; Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the 
;;		first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum 
;;		is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
;; Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first 
;;		one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
