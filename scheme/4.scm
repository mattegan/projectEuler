;; Project Euler Problem #4
;; A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from 
;;		the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
;; Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
;;
;; Answer : 906609

;; v1
;; notes:
;;	-- this could be done faster with some other interesting speedups, but this way
;;		seems to be the most "funcitonal" (and it works)
;; -- I'm using gambit scheme, which doesn't include a lot of functions that MIT-scheme
;;		includes, I'm using this as a feature, not a bug, since it causes me to figure
;;		out how to re-implement a lot of included "fluffy" convienience functions
